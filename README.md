# WeDance Community

We are international community of dancers getting together to help one another out.

**Our mission:** Unite dancers worldwide, spread dancing and dance culture, make it available for everyone everywhere.


**Focused**. Dance networking is getting messy in social networks. It's rather a sensitive topic and not always you want to share your passion with your friends, family and colleagues and want to keep it separate. Also it's difficult to find dance related topics out of spam, cats pictures and ads. We aim to quality content.

**Reliable**. All-in-one social networks are getting banned or blocked in different countries.

**Inspirational**. Dance community lacks creators, who would contribute blog posts, videos, podcasts, illustrations. But among dancers we have a lot of different experts in those fields. We enable creators to inspire dancing by providing technical online support and tools.

## Where idea of WeDance come from?

I love to dance and I love to travel. As a dancer in my city I have lots of groups in Facebook and Whatsapp and there is only spam and thousands of reposts of the same event. As a traveler I don't have any groups and can't find anyone or any events in cities where I travel to. That's how I got an idea for WeDance. Once I was traveling to Italy, visited lots of cities and couldn't find any salsa party there. So I want to help dancers to find parties no matter if they travel to a new city or just are new to the city. My goal is to be able to travel around the world and easily find dance events and partners, for this to happen each major city should have at least 1000 dancers. 

Let's build open source, non for profit, democratic dance community together ðŸ™‚
